# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

`have-a-break` is a Rust terminal game collection designed as short, bounded study-break games. The design principle: every game has a natural stopping point (attempt-boxed, completion-boxed, or time-boxed) so the player can genuinely stop after one session.

Planned games: Snake, Graph Coloring, Tower of Hanoi, Pattern Guesser, Sliding Puzzle, 2048, Estimation Challenge, Typing Speed, Hangman with categories.

Before implementing any game, check that cargo build passes cleanly. After implementing any game, run cargo clippy and fix all warnings before moving on.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build          # debug build
cargo build --release
cargo run            # run the app
cargo test           # run all tests
cargo test <name>    # run a single test by name/module
cargo clippy         # lint
```

## Planned architecture

Each game is a module under `src/games/` and implements a common trait — roughly `fn run(terminal: &mut Terminal) -> GameResult` — so `main.rs` dispatches to whichever game the player selects and gets back a result.

## Key crates (to be added)

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ratatui` | TUI layout, widgets, rendering |
| `crossterm` | Raw input events, cursor, color (ratatui backend) |
| `rand` | RNG, shuffling, distributions |
| `petgraph` | Graph structure for Graph Coloring (optional) |

Word lists are embedded directly into the binary using `include_str!()` — no external file dependency at runtime.

## Design constraints

- No async, no network, no database — intentionally simple
- Each game session should complete in under 3 minutes
- No "play again" prompt; the game ends and returns to the main menu
- Word lists come from `assets/words.txt` or `/usr/share/dict/words`, embedded at compile time

## Conventions

- Write unit tests for every change and make sure they pass
- Prioterize readability over cleverness
- Maintain all over the project clean and complete rustdoc docstrings
- Keep the overall architecture extensible to add at any time new games
